# Myrkwood: Offshoot (v3)
Hello, this is the update adding the aforementioned new gamemode to the game: **Dungeons**. **Dungeons** is an endless dungeon crawler where you travel through randomly generated rooms and fight waves of monsters that spawn in those rooms. I made this gamemode because I felt like the game could definitely be expanded to be more interesting and replayable, hopefully you enjoy it. I'd like to take more time to test & thoroughly make sure this version works better than **v2** which was super buggy and unfunctional, frankly. I'd love to also add a competitive gamemode in the future. 

I also added two weapons to the game: The Boomerang & Throwing Daggers. They both mixup the combat system with their own unique mechanics. I had a lot of fun playing around with this weapon. You can get these weapons by simply playing the game. You'll get a notification that you obtained a new weapon after 20 minutes of gameplay. I'd love to add more weapons in the future that lean on the more sillier side... a bubble wand maybe? 

## Changes:
- Added the Plains Dungeon. 
- Added support for new weapons with two new weapon types: Throwable & Boomerang.
- Added the current Sword & Outfit as the Wooden Sword & T-Shirt which are added by default. 
- Added the new loadout menu, which allows you to change your armor & your weapons which carries over to your games.
- Tweaked texture quality settings on Godot a bit.
- Fixed an issue where the game will not work if you don't have the Steam client. 
- Added two new variants: the **Rapid Bauble** and the **Angry Bauble**. The Rapid Bauble will start rapidly shooting out stars when in range and will not stop unless you get too close. The Angry Bauble shoots out bursts of 3 stars and will quickly overwhelm you.
- Made Baubles float.
- Enemies are removed from the scene instead of killed (bypassing kill logic like for the Mother Slime.)
- Fixed the odds for the Mother Slime/Poison Slime spawning.
- Added the smoke effect for every mob spawning.
- Fixed an issue where clients on players' servers can't use their appropriate UI.
- Made it so the UI couldn't show up when you die.
- Nerfed the Poison Slime's HP a bit.
- Updated GodotSteam to 4.4.
