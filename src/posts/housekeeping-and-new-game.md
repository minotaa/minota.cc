# Housekeeping & New Game
Moved things around a little bit to make it more generic and whatever. Mostly just going to use it for if people are interested in what I have to make. Additionally, I'd like to support Beachside Tactics still and make another update so people can have some more replayability, hopefully. 

Additionally, I'm hoping to make a new game, it'll be a game I'd like to release on Steam (Steam having multiplayer support) & itch.io while also having singleplayer iOS & Android ports. Hopefully, you'll play it, here's the concept for it so far: The game is intended to take place in space with a randomized map so that you have a new experience every single day, you have to manage your time right so that you don't waste your week, miss the quota and lose the game. You, and hopefully other players if the Steam version comes out, go around the map and collect the resources (i.e. mining, drilling, foraging, etc.) to craft machines while fighting off enemies that appear as you go through the day. Additionally, there would be natural disasters that happen sometimes during the day to make harvesting resources even harder.
