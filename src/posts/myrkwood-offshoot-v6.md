# Myrkwood: Offshoot (v6)

Fixed some bugs to improve game a bit. Will add more content in v7. 

- Removed toasts for adding gold and added it to your gold count instead making the screen less cluttered.
- Fixed navigation for some enemies going into trees.
- Fixed being disconnected by the server closing/connection failing not properly removing your multiplayer.
- Made it so Pajamas granted hit cooldown when blocking damage.
- Fixed your UI disappearing when you were a client in another person's game.
