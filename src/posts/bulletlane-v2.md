# Bulletlane: v2 
- Added missions & mission streaks, you can do certain tasks to get gems which will be used to buy cars in the future.
- Fixed the game spawning multiple obstacles on top of each other (there's a cooldown for obstacles spawning so no two obstacles can spawn at once).
- The game is significantly slower at the beginning, allowing you to have more time to prepare for the ramp up.
- Added toasts so notifications can pop up to indicate stuff like you completing missions.
- Made the road block & the missile's "appearance" speed dependent on the game's ramp up speed.
- Unincluded in the actual app's patch notes, the main menu's buttons have been moved around and a Discord & GameCenter button was added.

Now out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bulletlane/id6743356289).
