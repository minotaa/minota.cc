# Bulletlane: v4
- Added side arms, a shop upgrade you can purchase to shoot bullets diagonally.
- Renamed Bullets to Main Weapon to facilitate the Side Weapons making sense.
- Increased the max tier for main/side arms to 6.
- Fixed an issue with streaks.
- Fixed an issue where you couldn't progress in a certain mission.
- Made missions more difficult to make missions more... interesting.
- Added a new enemy tier.
- Added the Nissan Skyline. (this won't be actually seen until next update.) 
- Made the game slightly more faster at the beginning.
- Removed the full missile pattern's game ramp-up dependent delay as I felt it was too unfair.

Now out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bulletlane/id6743356289).
