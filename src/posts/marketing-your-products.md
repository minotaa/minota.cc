i made a hytale server — it's called raimu
we made it have a simple ffa arena and made duels, kind of advanced for a hytale server about 6 days into the game's lifetime, at least i think so. i actually took the time to search across servers already made and it's just empty promises & barebones survival servers which makes me wonder what appeal there is to playing such a server when we made a more functioning product. 

i completely burnt out all my energy almost rushing to release the server. i actually had a headache about it and was super stressed out and irritable at the time, horrible time to be making stuff. 

it still feels unfair that it gets about no attention, even though i can completely comprehend why since i'm not good at marketing any of my products, this sentiment i share with pretty much anything i create nowadays, which is usually games. i suck at marketing since i suck at being a social creature so anything i make or post is but a drop in the ocean. 
perhaps there's a way to offset this responsibility, i'm not sure, regardless hopefully one day i'll make something that everyone will see and like.
