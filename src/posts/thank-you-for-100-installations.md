# 100 Myrkwood Installations
Nice milestone! At least I think so, I'm currently working on my third game (which is not the mining game) which will be released on the App Store soon, it's inspired by an old game I played back in 2016, I think you'll find it very fun. It'll be called "unnamed car game" for now. 

Myrkwood still isn't dead, however, I will try to release more updates and finalize the completed concept for the Endless mode that I intended to make in the first place.
