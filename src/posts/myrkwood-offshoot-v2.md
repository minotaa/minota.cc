# Myrkwood: Offshoot (v2)
Hello, I've been working on adding a new gamemode to the game, but in the meantime I'd like to send out this update to simply help with the launch of the Steam version of the game.

## Changes:
* Added a mode/map selector.
* Added the Desert map.
* Renamed the first map to Plains.
* Added Sprint key to Controls.
* The Gem can no longer die twice (causing two game overs).
* You have invincibility frames when respawning preventing unnecessary damage.
* Updated Godot Engine to 4.5
* Updated EOSG to 2.2.4
* Added a new variant of the slime called the Poison Slime, which has a 10% chance to deal damage per hit.
* Added Steamworks support to the game, which Rich Presence labels and such.
