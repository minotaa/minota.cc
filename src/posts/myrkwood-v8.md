# Myrkwood: v8 
Myrkwood v8 came out yesterday and this mostly has hotfixes for certain bugs that appeared because of v7, however I will list what's new here:

- New loading screen.
- Balanced & fixed enemy's gold drops in Endless.
- Fixed leaderboards counting your Endless progress.
- Upgraded game engine to Godot 4.4.
- Fixed a bug that could happen because of the game trying to play sound.

Now out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/myrkwood/id6738539616).
