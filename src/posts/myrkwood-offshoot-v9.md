# Myrkwood: Offshoot (v9)
Hello! It's been a while since I released the release build, here's an update, additionally, I'm announcing a mobile port of Myrkwood: Offshoot, hopefully you can get excited for that.

# Changes:
- Added a new boss system, every 20 waves on Defense a boss will spawn, the first boss added is the Bombrat King. The Bombrat King moves around the map spawning bombrats and will occasionally make shockwaves, it's up to you and your party to defeat the bombrat before his timer reaches down and he rushes the Gem and deals 50 HP to it.
- Made it so inventory slots when focused on controller won't expand in a weird way.
- Added chat to the pre game lobby allowing you to chat with players before you start your game.
- Allowed players to change options mid-game.
- Changed barrier text because it was too buggy.
- Made it so that rooms open instantly after defeating all enemies in a wave, additionally made it so that you can end the shop phase early by all players moving to the end of the room, making the flow of Dungeons faster.
- Added zoom to options, allowing players to change zoom before the game, and it saves as well.
- Changed the text in the Back button to "Leave" when you're a client, "Disband" when you're the host.
- Made it so that not having Steam won't crash the game.
- Added the Rebound Boomerang, like a regular boomerang, targets an enemy after hitting one.
- Fixed Slime AI so that they won't immediately hop to the player's spawn or do impossible hops.
- Removed Loadout level progress and moved it to the Loadout menu.
- Fixed pause menu being spammable in a weird way.
- Fixed Extra Inventory Slot upgrade not working.
- Added an attack cooldown on swords/throwables making it justify an attack stat that decreases/increases these stats.
- The Stone Longsword has a slower attack cooldown than the regular sword now, making it not a direct upgrade.
- Moved/changed around the UI in-game a bit.
- Poison Slime has a 30% chance to poison you now.
- Moved the game logo down a bit.
- Removed player knockback.
- Made it so enemies clear out after you game over.
- Renamed Joro's Blessing to Golden Heart.
- Added textures to every status effect currently in the game and added a UI allowing you to view your current status effects.
- Added mobile support allowing players to play Myrkwood: Offshoot on their mobile phones.
