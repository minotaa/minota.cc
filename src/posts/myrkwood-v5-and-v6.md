# Myrkwood: **v5 and v6**
The app is now released on the App Store: https://apps.apple.com/us/app/mirkwood/id6738539616

Added ad support (this adds the ability to watch ads to get gems & the ability to double your rewards in a level), fixed up most of the menus to stretch better on different devices, added different textures for when you're wearing different armor (although this is broken because of Godot for some reason), changed renderer to `Compability` to allow for the iOS Simulator (and more devices) to run the game.

This version also marks the final version system for the game, which will be the singular integer format, the next version will be *v7* (or simply *7*)
