## P.S.
Honestly, this was tough to do. I have no idea why Steam has been such a strange and unusual experience for me but I was genuinely very happy to wake up randomly in the morning and find out that my game has finally been accepted and I can finally push it out on Steam.

...I will say that I think the game right now is super proof of concept and definitely needs more work. When I played the game myself, I liked the general gameplay but it was definitely getting stale for me. I don't think the current gamemode right now can really be stretched to infinity like I can with other gamemodes. I say gamemodes because the game was always initially planned to have multiple gamemodes and many ways to play the game simply because I thought it would be cool if it was easy to swap and change aspects of the game like having custom maps and what not. The next planned gamemode will be a roguelike (Dungeon). It'll be fun to make a dungeon generator and basically make revitalize the game to make it much more fresh and infinitely more replayable. Plus, I can definitely stretch it out more by adding much more unique mechanics to make it fun to play.
