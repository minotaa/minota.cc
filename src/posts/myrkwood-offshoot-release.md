# Myrkwood: Offshoot (v1)
Well, this is the fourth and newest game I made, it's a top-down survival defense game where you defend your objective from monsters that attempt to crack it and eventually shatter it. The main draw to the game is its multiplayer features that allow multiple players to play with you at once. 

Right now it's available on **itch.io** but it'll soon be available on Steam. https://minota.itch.io/myrkwood-offshoot
