# Myrkwood: Offshoot (v8)
I kinda forgot to make this post. Again, in response to v7, this is mostly bug fixes/balancing changes.

## Changes:
- Added more Solmere dungeon rooms.
- Added Cactus Armor & Stone Longsword.
- Changed Dealmaker to Lucky Charm, which is meant to be better thematically.
- Fixed being unable to login to your Steam account on EOS.
- Fixed being unable to select your inventory items while playing, this is now fixed, you can now use the shoulders to select inventory slots instead of using the Left Shoulder to Sprint (which has been moved to Left Trigger). Additionally, we added a new dedicated button (Left Action Button on most controllers) to use your current item.
- Added a flick controller option, which allows you to change how you attack by letting go of the cursor to immediately attack, which might feel better for some.
- Added enemy source to the player damage method so that we can do stuff like damage reflection because I just realized that wasn't implemented.
- Fixed an instance of the Mini Enrichment Potion giving "Regeneration" and not "Enrichment".
- Fixed multiplayer replication to send on change instead of always to help network performance.
- Fixed some bugs that may cause a crash.
- Fixed Dodge giving a 50% chance instead of 5%.
- Fixed being unable to take knockback while having chat open.
- Make empty Throwables blank instead of having a Dagger texture so it doesn't look weird in multiplayer.
- Buffed the Blunderbuss
  - Decreased the spread from 15° to 3°.
  - Increased the attack to 15->20.
  - Increased the clip to 4->5.
- Buffed the Strength Totem.
  - Increased the range of the Strength Totem from 80 -> 120.
  - Increased the tick rate from every 5s to every 7.5s.
  - However, the Strength effect is 15 seconds instead of 5 seconds.
  - Additionally, the duration has been changed from 45 seconds to 90 seconds.
