# Bulletlane: v10
- Added the new '98 Subaru Impreza, a new car that you can purchase for 500 Gems that allows you to fire an autonomous laser beam that deals damage every *frame*.
- Added a new tier of stronger enemies.
- Added more sound effects and some accompanying sound effects to go along with the new car.
- Added an ad when you die that's rewarded interstitial, meaning you can skip it or watch it to receive a reward.
- Made the boost effect's speed instantenous instead of when the next wave of enemies spawn.

Now out on the [App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bulletlane/id6743356289).
