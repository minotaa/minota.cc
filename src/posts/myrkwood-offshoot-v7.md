# Myrkwood: Offshoot (v7)
I was making bug fixes for v6, and I thought of some features I'd like to add to the game, I also found a lot of bugs while doing it, so here you go. I hope you enjoy it.

## Changes:
- Added decorations to Dungeons.
- Added overheal, which is temporary HP added on top of your normal health, which lets you take more damage at once.
- Added critical hits which let you deal 2.5x damage.
- Added Tossables which are a derivative of Consumable that lets you throw an item on the ground and have it do some for a short while.
- Added 3 tossable: Strength Totem, Wind Totem, and Healing Totem.
- Unified all enemy scripts to a generic Entity superclass to simplify adding features.
- Fixed a bug where being hit and attacking would make the text color on the damage indicators be wrong.
- Renamed the Plains Dungeon to Lysawood.
- Made it so Dungeons can accept multiple maps instead of having hardcoded values.
