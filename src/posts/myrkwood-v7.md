# Myrkwood: **v7**
I actually thought of the name `Mirkwood` before actually seeing if it was available and when putting it into the App Store Connect I found out it wasn't actually available which is why it became `Mirkwood.`, I'm going with the final name of `Myrkwood` which should hopefully help with SEO and make the game easier to search up online.

The following update is a lot, so here's a list of changes:
- Added Endless mode
- Added separate save data for the settings, endless run, and current campaign.
- New items: Bullfrog Armor, Venomous Axe, Carapace Armor, Tempered Exoskeleton, Pincers & Poison Orb
- New enemies: Frog, Warm Frog, Poison Slime, Shy Crab
- New levels: Heket, The Apothecary, Glue and Anomura
- New status effect: Poison (Damages an enemy/player by 5% of its max health)
- The consumable loadout option has been removed, allowing players to use all available consumables in battle using a carousel.
- Fixed a bug where the permanent health of an enemy could be depleted by Bleed.
- Fixed the player sprites going white for some reason.
- Shifted some things around.
...probably fixed some more that's not on this list
