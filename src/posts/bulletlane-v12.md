# Bulletlane: v12
- Fixed the game being unable to load from v11.
- Added texture tints.
- Added random different backgrounds for whenever you start a new game to make it more interesting.
- The game will no longer start from the most difficult tier immediately allowing your scores to be higher and your progression to feel real.
- Changed the UI & the icon.
- Removed ads for now until it's fixed.
- Fixed missions text trailing offscreen.

Now out on the [**App Store**](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bulletlane/id6743356289).
