# Bulletlane: v9

Part 1:
- Powerups aren't destroyed when you're alive (i.e. gas tanker explosion).
- Various places in the game used the wrong tier for bullet/armor/side arm which caused various bugs (like being unable to buy upgrades for the appropriate car), this is now fixed.
- Fixed the game pausing while you were on the Continue screen.
- Various tweaks behind the scenes to add Android support.
- Continue screen timer has been decreased from 6 to 5.
- The health bar is fixed so it's not just capped at 100 HP (the default HP).
- Added a delay to the revival when watching an ad.
- Watching an ad now pauses the game properly.

Part 2:
- Fix ads not being destroyed in pause menu and dead screen when going to the main menu or playing a new game.
- Fix powerup timers being a lil' offset.
- Fix a mission not counting at all.
- Added red bullets and purple enemies, stronger enemy variants and stronger bullet upgrades.
- Added more missions.
- Added in-app purchases so you can exchange them for real-world money.
