# Myrkwood: Offshoot (v5)
Hello once again, this update adds 2 new tracks to the game that allow the game's ambience/vibe to feel significantly better. They were produced by [Jorel Simpson](https://www.youtube.com/@jorelsimpson). Please check them out if you're interested. Regardless, this update comes with more features that'll be interesting to check out.

## Changes:
 - Added 2 new tracks to the game by Jorel. Additionally, added a Music volume slider so you can change the volume for the two.
- Added the **Ghost**, **Gunk Slime** & **Explosive Bauble**. These new enemies will be integrated into Defense, and will be implemented into Dungeons in their own waves at a later time.
- Added the **Blunderbuss**. A new weapon that lets you shoot out 3 bullets that work effectively at close range.
- Added the **Dealmaker**, **Vampire Fangs**, and **Pajamas**. Three new armor pieces that come with their own benefits.
- Fixed potion effects not showing the bubbles & add a sound effect when you drink a potion.
- Added a slash effect when you swing a sword.
- Made it so that when players hit each other you knocked each other back, this is to prevent getting stuck... and also it'd probably be fun to mess around with.
- Fixed the AI for **Baubles** so they don't fly off-screen for some reason.
- Revamped Plains & Desert to have more decorations & better layouts. Additionally, they are now renamed to **Lysawood & Solmere**. Lysawood also wraps around if you walk to the edge.
- Revamped the Main Menu to account for the **Lysawood** map update.
